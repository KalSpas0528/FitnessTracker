For weight loss, consider this comprehensive approach:

1. Workout Plan:
   â€¢ Combine cardio and strength training.
   â€¢ Start with 3-4 days of 30-minute cardio sessions (e.g., jogging, cycling, swimming).
   â€¢ Include 2-3 days of full-body strength training.
   â€¢ Focus on exercises that engage multiple muscle groups.
   â€¢ Gradually increase intensity and duration as you progress.

2. Nutrition:
   â€¢ Create a moderate calorie deficit (about 500 calories per day for 1 pound loss per week).
   â€¢ Increase protein intake to preserve muscle (aim for 1.6-2.2g per kg of body weight).
   â€¢ Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.
   â€¢ Include plenty of vegetables for nutrients and fiber.
   â€¢ Control portion sizes.
   â€¢ Limit processed foods and sugary drinks.
   â€¢ Stay hydrated with water.

3. Lifestyle:
   â€¢ Get adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night).
   â€¢ Manage stress through techniques like meditation or yoga.
   â€¢ Stay consistent with your routine.
   â€¢ Track your progress, but don't obsess over daily weight fluctuations.

Remember, sustainable weight loss is typically 0.5-1 kg (1-2 lbs) per week. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new diet or exercise program.`;

3. Include complex carbohydrates for energy.
4. Don't neglect healthy fats.
