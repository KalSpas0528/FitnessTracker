   • Focus on whole, unprocessed foods

3. Lifestyle:
   • Get adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night)

   • Stay consistent with your routine

Remember, sustainable weight loss is typically 0.5-1 kg (1-2 lbs) per week. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new diet or exercise program.`;
