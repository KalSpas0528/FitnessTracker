   â€¢ Include 2-3 days of full-body strength training.
   â€¢ Focus on exercises that engage multiple muscle groups.
   â€¢ Gradually increase intensity and duration as you progress.

2. Nutrition:
   â€¢ Create a moderate calorie deficit (about 500 calories per day for 1 pound loss per week).
   â€¢ Increase protein intake to preserve muscle (aim for 1.6-2.2g per kg of body weight).
   â€¢ Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.
   â€¢ Include plenty of vegetables for nutrients and fiber.
   â€¢ Control portion sizes.
   â€¢ Limit processed foods and sugary drinks.
   â€¢ Stay hydrated with water.

3. Lifestyle:
   â€¢ Get adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night).
