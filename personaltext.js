I'll revise the scripts to be more conversational and incorporate information from your portfolio while removing future-focused content. Here are the updated 2-minute scripts:

TECHNOLOGY VIDEO SCRIPT:
"Hi everyone! I'm [your name], and I'm excited to share PowerTitan with you - it's a fitness tracking platform I've created that's changing how people approach their fitness goals.

Let me show you what makes PowerTitan special from a technical standpoint. I've built it using a modern tech stack that includes:

- A responsive frontend using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3
my backend consists of 
- Node.js and Express for server-side management
- Supabase for secure database management
-Render for cloud based hosting
all of these backend principles combine to make a fast-easy- and seameless transition to creating and adding your workouts
- And my pride and joy - the Titan AI chatbot that I custom-built to be your personal fitness assistant


What really sets PowerTitan apart is how these technologies work together. The AI chatbot, for example, doesn't just give generic advice - it can calculate your BMI, recommend protein intake, and even create personalized workout plans. It's like having a personal trainer in your pocket!

I've also implemented:

- Real-time workout tracking that syncs across devices
- Secure user authentication to protect your data
- An intuitive dashboard that visualizes your progress
- A nutrition tracking system that helps you meet your goals


The best part? Everything is modular and connected. When you log a workout, it automatically updates your progress charts. When you track your nutrition, it helps the AI give better recommendations. It's all about creating a seamless experience that actually helps people stay committed to their fitness journey.

PowerTitan shows how we can use technology to make fitness tracking more accessible and, honestly, more enjoyable for everyone. Thank you!"

ENTREPRENEURSHIP VIDEO SCRIPT:
"Let me tell you about a problem I discovered - most people struggle to maintain their fitness routines, and existing apps aren't helping. In fact, 67% of gym memberships go unused, and 80% of people struggle to stick to their fitness goals. That's where PowerTitan comes in.

I designed PowerTitan to be different. Instead of overwhelming users with complex features, it provides:

- Simple, intuitive workout tracking
- AI-powered guidance that actually understands you
- Easy-to-use nutrition monitoring
- Built-in motivation features to keep you going


What makes this solution work? It's the integration. Everything you need is in one place, working together seamlessly. The AI assistant isn't just a chatbot - it's a knowledgeable fitness companion that learns from your data and provides personalized advice.

Our business model is straightforward:

- A free tier that gives users essential tracking tools
- Premium features including advanced AI coaching and detailed analytics
- Partnership opportunities with fitness professionals and gyms


What sets us apart from competitors?

1. Our AI technology that provides truly personalized guidance
2. A user-friendly interface that doesn't overwhelm
3. An all-in-one solution that eliminates app-switching
4. Direct user feedback implementation for continuous improvement


PowerTitan isn't just another fitness app - it's a comprehensive solution that addresses real user needs in the $96 billion global fitness market. Thank you!"

SCIENCE VIDEO SCRIPT:
"PowerTitan is where computer science meets exercise science and behavioral psychology. Let me show you how science drives every aspect of this platform.

At its core, PowerTitan is built on three scientific pillars:

First, Exercise Science:

- We use evidence-based workout programming
- Implement proper exercise progression principles
- Follow scientific training methodologies
For example, our workout tracking system isn't just counting reps - it's designed around proven progressive overload principles.


Second, Behavioral Psychology:

- We've incorporated habit formation techniques
- Applied motivation psychology
- Used goal-setting theory in practice
The motivation quotes feature, for instance, isn't random - it's timed to provide encouragement when users typically need it most.


Third, Computer Science:

- Our AI uses natural language processing to understand user queries
- We've implemented data analytics for progress tracking
- The system learns from user interactions to provide better recommendations


The Titan AI chatbot is a perfect example of these sciences working together. It combines:

- Exercise science knowledge for workout advice
- Psychological principles for motivation
- Advanced algorithms for personalized responses


What makes this really special is how these elements work together. When you're tracking workouts, the AI uses that data to provide better nutrition advice. When you're logging meals, it helps optimize your workout recommendations.

PowerTitan demonstrates how scientific principles can create practical, effective fitness solutions that actually help people achieve their goals. Thank you!"

These scripts maintain the core content while being more conversational and incorporating real examples from your portfolio. Would you like me to adjust anything further?
